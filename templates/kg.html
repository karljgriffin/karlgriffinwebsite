<h3>Chemistry PhD Student, Coder, Interested in Working at the Intersection of Science & Tech
</h3>
<br>       
<p>
Hi, I am 26 years old and I am currently in third year of a chemistry PhD at University College Dublin. I completed my undergraduate degree here in 2019, and aim to complete my PhD by January 2023.
</p> 
<p>
My research is interdisciplinary and involves the study of organic nanomaterials and their applications in neuromorphic or 'brain-inpsired' computing. See 'Education' for more details.
</p> 
<p>
I also have a keen interest in computer programming which I began teaching myself at the beginning of my PhD. I enjoy coding in my spare time as well as taking every available opportunity to implement it in my research. I have experience using Python, postgreSQL, as well as web development using HTML, CSS and Flask. See 'Skills' for further elaboration.
