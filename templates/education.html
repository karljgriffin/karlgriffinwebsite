Our research is focussed on developing organic memristive devices for next-generation computing. Read below for a bit of background information on my topic (written by Karl Griffin 2021):

"Over the past few decades, the exponential growth of electronics and computing capacity has drastically altered the way in which we live, work and interact. Typically, the demand for faster, cheaper, more efficient computing has been answered by device miniaturisation, but with impending physical limits approaching, innovative materials and device design are needed to power advances in fields ranging from data storage, bioelectronics, to neuromorphic computing. Ever-growing gulfs exist between the energy efficiency and computational complexity required by data scientists and the hardware capacity available from current architectures, a demand that complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) scaling alone looks unable to fill. Conventional computation is based on the von Neumann chip architecture with energy and time-expensive separation between memory and computation execution. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming increasingly more important. Although they aim to mimic the workings of the human brain, they are typically implemented on a software level (neural networks in deep learning) rather than physically emulated in hardware. To power advances in the next-generation of computing, artificial electronic synapses (e-synapses) are necessary in order for the effective implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in hardware to occur. Thus, a hardware platform modelled on a biomimetic brain is emerging as one of the most promising ways to enable a high degree of parallelism akin to the human brain which would offer much greater processing speed and energy efficiency as opposed to the current von Neumann architecture which operates sequentially.

Memristors are two-terminal switches which can encode information in the form of programmable internal resistance, the evolution of which can be modulated by the history of its external stimuli. The ability to increment the conductance, or decrease the resistance, of memristors is akin to increasing the synaptic weight between neurons (otherwise known as potentiation) during the learning process which underpins the plasticity of the human brain. Memristive devices, or resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) devices, often offer multi-level or ‘multi-bit’ memory. This particular class of memristors are known as analog memristors, as opposed to digital ReRAM devices which operate via two well-separated / defined states (binary operations) in which a large memory window, or ‘ON/OFF’ ratio is of key importance. For analog memristors, incremental increases in conductance are ideal for neuromorphic computing applications, as this can successfully mimic the weight-update process of the human brain. Memristors are capable of facilitating the co-location of memory and computation, overcoming the ‘von Neumann bottleneck’ (the aforementioned separation between memory and computation execution), with the subsequent potential to eradicate ever-more problematic issues afflicting conventional computing such as the heat dissipation problem. The fact that memory and computation can be carried out in the same place lend memristors ‘synaptic-like’ functionality, and this is what enables memristors to be a promising candidate to behave as the synaptic element in ANNs required for machine learning / DL operations (when organised into a cross-bar structure, each cross-point becomes a memory element capable of performing vector matrix multiplication with a low energy cost and high integration density). Recently, increasing attention is being given to organic materials, typically polymer-based memristors, as the search continues for a single material system possessing all of the necessary properties for next-generation computing which has so far been elusive. These materials offer the typical advantages inherent to organics such as low cost processing, flexibility, ease of tailorability, as well as biocompatibility."<br></i>

<b>Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee: </b>
Since January 2021 I have served as the postgraduate student rep on the UCD college of science EDI commitee repesenting the interests and concerns of the greater college of science postgraduate population. This is something I enjoy and am passionate about which I hope to continue advocating for during the rest of my time here.
